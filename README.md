# Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning a dataset using Python and Pandas. The dataset, "Customer Call List.xlsx," contains information about customers, including their names, phone numbers, addresses, and contact preferences. The code performs various cleaning tasks, such as removing duplicates, dropping unnecessary columns, standardizing values, and handling missing or incorrect data.
